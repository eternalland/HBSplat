# SCGaussian
SCGaussian is a structure consistent Gaussian Splatting method which leverages the matching prior to learn 3D consistent scene structure. SCGaussian optimizes the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To ahcieve this, SCGaussian presents a hybrid Gaussian representation consisting of ray-based Gaussian primitives and ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives. Details are described in our paper:

üìç If there are any bugs in our code, please feel free to raise your issues.

## ‚öô Setup
#### 1. Recommended environment
```
git clone https://github.com/prstrive/SCGaussian.git

conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate scgaussian

git clone https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization --recursive submodules
git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/bkerbl/simple-knn.git submodules
pip install submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization submodules/simple-knn

```

#### 2. Dataset Download

**LLFF dataset**

Download LLFF dataset from the official [download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1).

**DTU Dataset**

Download DTU dataset from the [official website](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36/) and download the mask for evaluation from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yt5T3LJ9DZDiHbtd9PDFNHqJAd7wt-_E/view?usp=sharing).

*Note: for DTU dataset, you first need to run `convert.py` to get the poses and the undistorted images.*

**Tanks&Temples Dataset**

For Tanks dataset, we adopt the date format provided by [Nope-NeRF](https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nope-nerf), and you can download them from [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~wenjing/Tanks.zip).

#### 3. Match Prior Extraction

We use GIM in our paper. Clone the GIM model from [here](https://github.com/xuelunshen/gim) and setup the enviroment following their instructions. We provide a script [here](data_preprocess/get_match_info.py) to extract match prior, and you need to specify your own data path first.

We provide our pre-extracted LLFF match priors [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZT9fal1uQaqUxLur3XIRtgqNvZD0H9VK?usp=sharing), and move the `match_data.npy` to the corresponding scene folder. The final data structure maybe likes this:
```
LLFF
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fern                          
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sparse
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ match_data.npy
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üöÄ Evaluation

#### 1. Optimization

Optimize the model for the specific scene first:
```
python train.py -s <path to scene> -m <path to save outputs> -r 8 --eval
```

#### 2. Rendering

Then render the novel view synthesis results:
```
python render.py -m <path to save outputs>
```

We also privide the video rendering script, which interpolates the camera motion withine the input camera poses:
```
python render_video.py -m <path to save outputs>
```

#### 3. Metrics

Compute the quantitative results:
```
python metrics.py -m <path to save outputs>
```

## ‚è≥ Customized Dataset

Our method is developded on 3DGS, and it can read and process your customized dataset using the same procedure declained in [3DGS repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), e.g., COLMAP format datasets.
